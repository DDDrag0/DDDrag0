### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am Michele, a young Java Developer but still, i know some of other Programming languages like C, R and a little bit of Python, PHP and  C++.</p>
<p>I have a strong interest on decompilation and reverse Engineering, also I am studying as self-taught how the JVM works and I am learning how to work with it.</p>
<p>My other interests are gaming, drawing, and dismantle things (like the games that I play).</p>
