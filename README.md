### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Michele, a young Java Developer, but I also have knowledge of other programming languages such as C, R, and a little bit of Python, PHP, and C++.</p>

<p>I have a strong interest in decompilation and reverse engineering. Additionally, I'm studying how the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) works and how to work with it on my own.</p>

<p>My other interests include gaming, drawing, and dismantling things, like the games I play.</p>
